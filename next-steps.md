## 📋 Recommended Steps

### Phase 0: API Research Sprint ✅ COMPLETE

**Timeline**: January 21-22, 2026 (2 days)
**Tools**: WebStorm HTTP Client, web research
**Agent**: Analyst Agent
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Validate the availability and feasibility of external APIs before starting implementation.

**Research Completed**:

- ✅ **IGDB** - Game metadata (SELECTED: Partial FR support, 4 req/sec free tier)
- ✅ **RAWG** - Alternative metadata (EVALUATED: English only, backup option)
- ✅ **PSN Trophies** - psn-api library (DEFERRED POST-MVP: Reverse-engineered, ban risk)
- ✅ **Xbox Achievements** - No free option (DEFERRED POST-MVP: XAPI.us £5/month)
- ✅ **Price Tracking** - IsThereAnyDeal API (DEFERRED POST-MVP: Focus on core MVP)
- ✅ **General Marketplaces** - eBay/Amazon/Leboncoin (NOT SUITABLE: No price history or approval required)

**Delivered Artifacts**:

- ✅ [Metadata API Research](/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/research/technical-api-metadata-jeux-research-2026-01-21.md) - IGDB selected
- ✅ [Price Tracking Research](/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/research/technical-price-tracking-wishlist-research-2026-01-22.md) - DEFERRED POST-MVP
- ✅ HTTP Client tests (http_client/igdb/auth.http, games.http) - IGDB validated
- ✅ Go/No-Go decisions documented per API

**Key Decisions**:

1. ✅ **IGDB for Metadata** - MVP will auto-fetch game data (title, cover, genre, platform)
2. ⏸️ **Trophies DEFERRED** - Manual entry only in MVP, psn-api researched for future
3. ⏸️ **Price Tracking DEFERRED** - Manual wishlist in MVP, IsThereAnyDeal researched for future
4. ✅ **Manual-First MVP** - Core CRUD + search without complex external APIs

**Pivot Applied**: Manual-first approach for MVP (no trophy sync, no automated price alerts)

### Phase 1: Technical Architecture ✅ COMPLETE

**Timeline**: January 26, 2026 (1 day)
**Agent**: Architect Agent (Winston)
**Workflow**: `workflow create-architecture`
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Define the Clean Architecture structure before writing any code.

**Delivered artifacts**:

- ✅ Complete Architecture Decision Document (`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`)
- ✅ Clean Architecture + DDD Bounded Contexts hybrid structure

- ✅ 15+ implementation patterns (naming, structure, format, communication)
- ✅ Complete project structure (200+ file paths documented)
- ✅ 3 bounded contexts defined (Collection, Wishlist, Maintenance)
- ✅ Project context file for AI agent consistency (`project-context.md`)

**Key decisions made**:

## 🎯 Shipping Discipline

**Golden rules**:

- ✅ **1 feature shipped per week** (no compromise)
- ✅ **Max 1 day of architecture per feature** (strict time-boxing)
- ✅ **"Good enough" code > Perfect code** (pragmatism)
- ✅ **5h/week max** (no burnout)
- ✅ **Weekends OFF** (unless naturally motivated)

**Kill Switches**:

- ⚠️ If architecture blocks shipping >2 weeks → Simplify
- ⚠️ If PWA takes >2 weeks → Pivot to LocalStorage
- ⚠️ If APIs unavailable → Pivot to manual-first

**Real-time documentation**:

- 📝 DECISIONS.md - Update every decision (within 24h)
- 📝 LEARNINGS.md - Weekly reflection every Friday (15min)
- 📝 REGRETS.md - Mistakes documented without shame

---

## 📊 Continuous Validation

**Every 2 weeks**:

- [ ] Team demo (safe feedback)
- [ ] LinkedIn/Twitter post (architecture insights)
- [ ] GitHub push with detailed commit message

**Monthly**:

- [ ] Blog post (500-1000 words, 1 specific learning)
- [ ] Demo video (5min, optional)

**Quarterly**:

- [ ] "3 months of Clean Arch React" summary post
- [ ] Conference submission (Devoxx/DevFest)
